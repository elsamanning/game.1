Hello!

This is my first time coding a game. It's going to be very simple and inspired by already existing games.
My notes will be stored in this txt document to plan and conceptualize this silly game.


NOTES:

- possible game title: "This Extincts!" or "Dino Doom" or

- dinosaur tries to dodge falling asteroids

- The theme/aesthetic of the game is retro/space/dinosaurs ???

- Color pallate: Double Split Complementary (Adobe Color)
    dark purple, green, yellow-orange, red

-Concept Ideas:
    Player enters a portal to dinosaur realm in space??
   
- Music:
    retro synth, goa-psytrance EDM, dino synth? lol
